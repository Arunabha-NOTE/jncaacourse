# 📘 NetDevOps Notes

## 🏛️ Traditional Network Operations
- Networks operated as individual components (e.g., service provider WANs, enterprise data centers).
- Operations heavily manual; CLI-based device configuration.
- Adding services often meant new physical installations.
- Limitations:
  - Lack of flexibility and scalability.
  - Manual failure remediation → longer downtimes.
  - Bottlenecks for modern applications.

## 🚀 Modern Network Operations
- Automation is essential for scale and agility.
- Network services must match application speed and complexity.
- Infrastructure is increasingly virtual:
  - Virtual switches, routers, and firewalls.
- Dynamic traffic optimization using telemetry data.

## 🔁 Modern Networking Trends
- Networks are parts of larger, dynamic projects.
- **Examples**:
  - Public cloud apps → multi-tenant resource sharing.
  - Scalable web services → dynamic multi-tier connections.
  - Telecom → content delivery (video, gaming, data).
- Networking treated like software:
  - Version control.
  - Code reviews.
  - Testing before deployment.

## 💻 Traditional Software Development (Waterfall Model)
- Linear, phase-by-phase approach:
  1. Requirements
  2. Design
  3. Implementation
  4. Testing
  5. Deployment
- Works well with fixed requirements.
- Limitations:
  - Inflexible to change.
  - Slow delivery.
  - Large release intervals increase failure risk.

## ⚡ Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 🔑 Key Characteristics:
- Continuous, reliable delivery.
- Embraces change for better customer satisfaction.
- Short, frequent release cycles.
- Ongoing communication between teams and stakeholders.
- Promotes sustainable development pace.
- Focuses on simplicity — do only what’s necessary.
- Teams continuously reflect and improve.

### 💡 Core Values (Agile Manifesto):
- **Individuals & interactions** > processes & tools
- **Working software** > comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** > contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** > following a fixed plan
